# Hotel_Booking_Analysis

The Hotel Booking Analysis Project is aimed at performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning on hotel reservation data. It provides analysis and visualizations on metrics such as cancellation percentage and reservation status for different types of hotels, including city hotels and resorts.

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing hotel reservation data to gain insights into booking patterns, cancellation rates, and other factors that impact hotel occupancy and revenue. By conducting EDA and data cleaning, we aim to uncover trends and patterns that can help hotel managers make informed decisions to optimize operations and maximize revenue.

## Features

- Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the reservation dataset.
- Conduct EDA to explore the distribution of booking and cancellation rates across different hotel types (e.g., city hotels, resorts).
- Generate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps) to present key insights and trends in hotel reservation data.
- Analyze cancellation percentages and reservation status trends to identify factors influencing booking decisions and cancellation behavior.

## Usage

To use the Hotel Analysis Project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., Python libraries, Jupyter Notebook).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis scripts.
4. Explore the analysis findings and visualizations to gain insights into hotel reservation data.

## Data

The hotel reservation dataset used in this project contains information about bookings made at various hotels, including reservation details, guest demographics, booking channels, and reservation status.
